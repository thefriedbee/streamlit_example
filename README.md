# A short tutorial about Streamlit

This repo contains 16 examples to go through the basics of **Streamlit**.

It is very similar to the mini course made by Tech With Tim [minicourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8p7uQCGD0U).

I made a similar video in Bilibili in Mandarin (Chinese) for reference [my course](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1m9SfYyEuw).
